# gocti

`gocti` is the [OpenCTI](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/) Go client library and a CLI tool.

It helps developers, admins and security engineers to use the OpenCTI API by providing Go bindings and a command line tool. This client is also used by the [OpenCTI Terraform provider](https://github.com/qba73/terraform-provider-opencti).
